# Python + Blockchain - Your Guide to Building Full Stack DApps
Welcome to the Full Stack DApp Workshop! You'll learn how to build a decentralized application (DApp) using Python with web3.py for the blockchain interaction, Truffle for smart contract development, and Node.js for the frontend. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create a full-stack DApp that can interact with the evm based blockchains.

# Introduction
### What is a DApp?
A DApp, short for decentralized application, is a type of software application that operates on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. Unlike traditional applications, DApps don't rely on a centralized server, making them more transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship.

In this workshop, we will build a simple DApp that demonstrates the core principles of decentralized applications.

### Technologies Used
1. **web3.py**: A Python library that allows interaction with Ethereum and evm based blockchains, including reading data from the blockchain and sending transactions.

2. **Truffle**: A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier.

3. **Ganache** : Local testing

4. **Metamask** : Wallet to send or receive transactions to/from contracts. Setup instructions [here](https://metamask.io/)
Once your wallets are setup, please load your wallets with SEPOLIA test ETH by going to this [link](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
   so load some test MATIC tokens by following [this link](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)
5. Explore Standard Smart Contracts [Here](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)
6. Familiarize yourself with Transaction monitoring platforms like [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/), [PolygonScan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
You can see if you have Python already installed on your machine by going to your terminal and typing:

```$ python --version```

OR:

```$ python3 --version```

Next setup web3.py
``` $ pip install web3```

2. **Node.js and npm**: Install [Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to manage JavaScript dependencies.

3. **Truffle**: Truffle is a popular development framework for Ethereum. Install it globally using npm:
```npm install -g truffle```
4. **RPC URL**: In order to connect to an Ethereum node with JSON RPC on the Main Net/ Test Net, we need access to a blockchain node. There are a few ways you could do this. For one, you could run your own Ethereum node with Geth or Parity. But this requires you to download a lot of data from the blockchain and keep it in sync. This is a huge headache if you've ever tried to do this before. For convenience, we will use [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) to access an Ethereum node without having to run one yourself. Infura is a service that provides a remote Ethereum node for free. All you need to do is sign up and obtain an API key and the RPC URL for the network you want to connect to.

Once you've signed up, your Infura RPC URL should look like this:

```https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY_GOES_HERE```

4. Install ganache in your system using
For Mac OS download from here: [Get Ganache for Mac OS](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
For Windows/ Ubuntu : Follow [this link](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart/)

## Let's do the setup for our new truffle project
#### What you will do
1. Install and set up Truffle
2. Deploy contract on Polygon Network/ Seoplia/ Ganache local node
3. Check the deployment status on chain

Let's setup a new project

If not already setup please have [Node.js v8+ LTS and npm (packaged with Node)](https://nodejs.org/en) setup.
1. Next we start by creating a new directory for this Truffle project:

```mkdir first_dapp && cd first_dapp```

2. Download the MetaCoin box:

```truffle unbox metacoin```

3. With that last step, you have created a Truffle project containing folders with contracts, deployment, testing, and configuration files.
4. Testing the Contract: We will run some pre loaded tests: 
```truffle test ./test/TestMetaCoin.sol```

``` truffle test ./test/metacoin.js```

5. Compile the smart contract using the following command:
``` tuffle compile ```

6. Before actually depolying the contract, you need to set up the truffle-config.js file, inserting network and compilers data.
```javascript
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },
    matic: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com`),
      network_id: 80001,
      confirmations: 2,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
        version: "0.8.13",
    }
  }
}
```

How to get mnemonics? Check the process [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015290032-How-to-reveal-your-Secret-Recovery-Phrase)

Let's deploy:

```
truffle compile
truffle deploy --network matic // can be any other network as well
```
